Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science that seeks to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI has been used to develop self-driving cars, facial recognition systems, natural language processing, and more. AI enables computers to learn from experience, adjust to changing circumstances, and come up with creative solutions to problems. AI is playing an increasingly important role in our lives, and as technology continues to evolve, so too will the applications of AI.
